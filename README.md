## Goals

-   Alfa sets out to strike a balance between false positives and negatives with the goal of having result sets reach a high [F<sub>1</sub> score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score). If a false negative is encountered, it is therefore just as important to avoid introducing a potential false positive as it is fixing the false negative.

## Funding

[<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/European_Commission.svg" width="200" align="right" alt="Logo of the European Commission">](https://ec.europa.eu/)

Alfa has been funded by the European Commission as part of the [Horizon 2020 Programme for Research and Innovation](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/). We would therefore like to give thanks to not only the European Commission for their grant but also you, as a European citizen, for your contribution to making Alfa possible!
